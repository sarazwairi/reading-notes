## A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files

Features to Look for in a Text Editor:
    -    code completion
    -   syntax highlighting.
    -  a nice variety of themes.
    - the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

Best Text Editors for Beginners:
     Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text

Side note: Text editors `!= IDE`:
Text editors are not the same as IDEs (integrated development environment). While almost every IDE has the capability of creating and editing plain text documents, they also include an abundance of other features.

The terminal(command line):

Shell A program that interprets commands Allows a user to execute commands by typing them manually at a terminal, or automatically in programs called shell scripts. A shell is not an operating system. It is a way to interface with the operating system and run commands.

BASH = Bourne Again Shell

Basic Commands and shortcuts :

* `Ls` List files in current directory
* `ls -la` Lists files in **long** format
* pwd **Print Working Directory**. Shows the current location in the directory tree
* `cd` **Change Directory** When typed all by itself, it returns you to your home directory.
* `Echo`  display text on the screen. Mostly useful when writing shell scripts. For example: echo **Hello World**
* up Down Arrow Keys for scroll through your most recent commands. You can scroll back to an old command, hit ENTER, and execute the command without having to re type it.
