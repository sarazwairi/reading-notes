# Django REST Framework & Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications inside Linux Containers.

### Image result for docker image vs container:
Docker images are read-only templates used to build containers. Containers are deployed instances created from those templates. Images and containers are closely related, and are essential in powering the Docker software platform.
