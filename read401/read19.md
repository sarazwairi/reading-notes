## Python Regular Expression Tutorial

* The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering. You will see some of them closely in this tutorial.

* Ordinary characters are the simplest regular expressions. They match themselves exactly and do not have a special meaning in their regular expression syntax.

* Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression. 

* The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern bounded by parenthesis () are called groups.

* When a special character matches as much of the search sequence (string) as possible, it is said to be a "Greedy Match".

## shutil â€” High-level File Operations

* copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

* By default when a new file is created under Unix, it receives permissions based on the umask of the current user. To copy the permissions from one file to another, use copymode().

* To remove a directory and its contents, use rmtree().

* To move a file or directory from one place to another, use move()

* The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file.

* Use make_archive() to create a new archive file.
