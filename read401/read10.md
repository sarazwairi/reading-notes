# Stacks and Queues


A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* Stacks are based on the LIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.
* Insertion and deletion in stacks takes place only from one end of the list called the top.
* Insert operation is called push operation.
* Delete operation is called pop operation.
* In stacks we maintain only one pointer to access the list, called the top, which always points to the last element present in the list.
* Stack is used in solving problems works on recursion.


# What is a Queue?

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 


* Queues are based on the FIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list.
* Insertion and deletion in queues takes place from the opposite ends of the list. The insertion takes place at the rear of the list and the deletion takes place from the front of the list.
* Insert operation is called enqueue operation.
* 	Delete operation is called dequeue operation.
* In queues we maintain two pointers to access the list. The front pointer always points to the first element inserted in the list and is still present, and the rear pointer always points to the last inserted element.
* Queue is used in solving problems having sequential processing.
