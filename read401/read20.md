# Intro to Django

Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. 

## All popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

* Corporate Sponsor 

* Solo

* Non-profit

### A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesnâ€™t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

### Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types.

### Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

###  It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. 

### Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

### Django provides multiple protections against:

    * Clickjacking 

    * Cross-site scripting

    * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

    * SQL injection
    
    * Remote code execution
