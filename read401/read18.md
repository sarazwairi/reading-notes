# Cryptography

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

*  Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).

* Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

* Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

We can now apply one of the simplest forms of encryption known as “Caesar’s Cipher” (also known as a shift cipher) to the message.

With this cipher, we simply shift each letter a set number of spaces up or down the alphabet.
