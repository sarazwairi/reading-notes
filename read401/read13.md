# Linear Regressions

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. 

```
    I explored the boston data set and then renamed its column names.
    I explored the boston data set using .DESCR, my goal was to predict the housing prices using the given features.
    I used Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculated the mean squared error.
    I made a train-test split and calculated the mean squared error for my training data and test data.
    I then plotted the residuals for my training and test datasets.
