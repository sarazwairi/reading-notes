# Machine Learning Intro

## Bird's Eye View


### Machine Learning â‰  Algorithms

Machine learning is not about algorithms.

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

### Machine Learning Tasks

* Supervised Learning:

    In practice, it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling. 

    Each observation must be labeled with a "correct answer."

    Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what's 
    "correct" while training it (hence, "supervising" it).

    Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.

    Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. "class") target variables.

* Unsupervised Learning


    In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction. 

    Unlabeled data has no predetermined "correct answer."

    You'll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without "supervision").

    Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data.

## Exploratory Analysis

correlations allow you to look at the relationships between numeric features and other numeric features.

## Data Cleaning

* Duplicate observations most frequently arise during data collection, such as when you:

    Combine datasets from multiple places 

    Scrape data

    Receive data from clients/other departments


## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

## Model Training

There are two types of parameters in machine learning algorithms.

The key distinction is that model parameters can be learned directly from the training data while hyperparameters cannot.
