## What is the script ?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

To acheive our goal, we should divide the task into smaller steps :

* Define the goal.
* Design the script (FlowChart).
* And code each step.

### jQuery

 It makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

## Expressions

 An expression results in a single value.

 Types of expressions :

 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE (For example - var color = 'beige' -).
 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE (For example - var area = 3*2; ).

## Operators

 Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

 Types of operators :

 1. Assignment operators(Assign value to a variable).
 2. Arithmetic operators(Perform basic math).
 3. String operators(Combine two strings).
