# Structure Web Pages with HTML

## Structure

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) defines the structure of a web page. The basic buildings block of HTML are elements defined by tags which enclose the content to be shown on the web page. An opening tag can contain attributes which provide additional information about an element. The closing tag indicates the end of the content.

## Extra Markup

Several HTML versions were created over the years, such as HTML 4, XHTML, which was derived from eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and lastly HTML 5. To specify the version the command DOCTYPE is used. For HTML5 the command is

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

- Comments can be added to the code which makes it easier to understand

`<!--- enter comment here --->`

- id and class attributes are used to uniquely identify elements so they are separately styled in CSS.

`<p class="important">enter text here</p>`

- Some elements always start on a new line, called block elements. These are ```<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>```. Other elements continue on the same line as the rest of the code, including ```<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>```

- The div element is used to divide contents into blocks to which unique attributes can be applied. The span works in a similar manner but for inline code.

- The iframe element is used for embedding another pages into a window in the web page.

- The meta element specifies some information which are not shown in the webpage but are used by search engines, such as description, author, and keywords.

- Escape characters are used to display characters that are resserved by HTML code.

## HTML Layout

- HTML layout elements allow for dividing the content of the web page.

- The ```<header>``` element typically contains site name and main navigation

- The ```<footer>``` element usually contains copyright information and privacy policy.

- ```<nav>``` contains the primary site navigation

- The ```<article>``` element contains a section of a page that can
become standalone.

- The ```<aside>``` element can be used in two ways:

  - When the ```<aside>``` element is used inside an ```<article>``` element, it should contain information related to the article but not as important as the rest article.

  - When the ```<aside>``` element is used outside of an ```<article>``` element, it has content related to the entire page.

- The ```<section>``` element assemble related content. Each section has its own heading.

- The elements ```<figure>``` and ```<figcaption>``` are useful for  inserting content such as images, videos, graphs, diagrams, and code
samples.

## Process & Design

- The website should be designed for the target audience, be it individuals or companies.

- The motivations and goals of the website visitors must be considered.

- How frequently people visit the website influences the design.

- A site map, which is a diagram of the web pages, must be created to structure the website.

- A wireframe is a sketch of the important information and how they are structured on a page.

- Visual hierarchy is important to convey the purpose of a website, where more important content draw more attention using visual contrast.

- Content that is related must be visually similar i.e. being of the same color, size, orientation, texture, font, or shape.

- The navigation bar must be clear, concise, and selective.
