# React Docs - thinking in React

* How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

```
We should draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
```

* What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

```
The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
```

* What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

```
A static build is a compiled version of a program which has been statically linked against libraries. The components will only have render() and no interactivity.
```

* Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

```
State to make the UI interactive
```

* What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

```
Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
```

* How can you identify where state needs to live?

```
Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
```
