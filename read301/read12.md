* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

 SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

* Give a real world example.

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL 

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

 fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data)

* Give a real world example.

Hbase

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL 

* Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL

* What does SQL stand for?

structure query language 

* What is a realational database?

that mean we have a database which works with certain assumptions or in certain way and it supports the sq language the structured query language such as a database works with tables 

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?

sq languge the structured query languge such as works with tables

* What is a ‘schema’?

collection of logical structures of data

* What is a NoSQL database?

that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first 

* How does it work?

Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.

* What is inside of a Mongo database?

doc and collections

* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

mongoDB dont have to use schema

* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

In NoSQL database you will have some duplicate data and if other data in a collection changes you need to update the other collection
